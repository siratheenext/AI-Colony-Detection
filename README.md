## 📖 Executive Summary
Counting bacterial colonies on petri dishes is a fundamental but tedious task in microbiology. Manual counting is time-consuming and prone to human error.

**Colony-Count-YOLO** is an end-to-end web application that automates this process using computer vision. It allows users to upload images, receive instant counts with visual bounding boxes, manually correct the results (Human-in-the-loop), and export reports. The system is containerized for easy deployment and supports GPU acceleration.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The system follows a microservices-like architecture, separating the heavy AI inference from the client-side interaction.

![Architecture Diagram](assets/images/system_architecture.png)

**Core Components:**
* **Frontend (Vue.js / Nuxt):** Handles image uploads and utilizes HTML5 Canvas for an interactive bounding-box editor (allowing users to add/delete/resize boxes).
* **Backend (FastAPI):** Asynchronous API that manages the inference pipeline, image storage, and database transactions.
* **AI Engine (Ultralytics YOLO):** Runs inference on the GPU, featuring custom logic for Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) tuning.
* **Database (SQLite/PostgreSQL):** Stores prediction history, metadata, and user-edited counts for future model fine-tuning.

## 🧠 AI Methodology & Training

### 1. Dataset Preparation
* **Data Collection:** Custom dataset of petri dish images.
* **Annotation:** Labeled using standard YOLO format (normalized coordinates).
* **Augmentation Strategy:** To ensure robustness against lighting variations, the following augmentations were applied during training:
    * *CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)*
    * *Random Brightness/Contrast*
    * *Mosaic & Mixup* (to handle overlapping colonies)
    * *Random Flip/Rotation*

### 2. Model Training
Trained using **YOLOv8 / YOLOv11** architectures via Transfer Learning.

* **Hyperparameters:**
    * `imgsz`: 832 (High resolution for small objects)
    * `epochs`: 100+ (with Early Stopping)
    * `batch`: 16
    * `optimizer`: AdamW

## 🚀 Key Features Highlights
1.  **Human-in-the-loop:** The AI provides the initial count, but users can refine the results. These "corrected" annotations are saved and can be used to re-train the model, creating a continuous learning loop.
2.  **Report Generation:** Automated PDF/CSV export containing image thumbnails, total counts, and confidence scores for lab records.
3.  **Adaptive Thresholding:** Users can adjust confidence thresholds dynamically on the frontend to filter out noise without re-running the model.
